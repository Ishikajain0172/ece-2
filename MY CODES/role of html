//What Role Does HTML Play on the Web?
HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for creating web pages.

HTML represents the content and structure of a webpage through the use of elements. Most elements will have an opening tag and a closing tag.This content can be text or other HTML elements.

Here is a small example using HTML elements. 
<h1>Main heading element</h1>
<p>I am a paragraph element.</p>

Both opening and closing tags start with a left angle bracket (<), and end with a right angle bracket (>), with the tag name placed between these angle brackets. While HTML tag names are case-insensitive, it is a widely accepted convention and best practice to write them in lowercase.

Here is a closer look at just the opening and closing paragraph tags:
<p>
</p>
What distinguishes an opening tag from a closing tag is the forward slash (/) placed immediately after the left angle bracket in a closing tag. Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These are known as void elements.

Here is an example of an image element which is a void element:

<img>
Notice that this image element does not have the closing tag and it does not have any content. Void elements cannot have any content and only have a start tag.

Sometimes you will see void elements that use a / before the > like this:

<img />
While many code formatters like Prettier, will choose to include the / in void elements, the HTML spec states that the presence of the / "does not mark the start tag as self-closing but instead is unnecessary and has no effect of any kind".

Here's an example of an image element with the src and alt attributes.
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Two tabby kittens sleeping together on a couch." />
The src attribute is used to specify the location for that image. The alt attribute is used to provide short, descriptive text for the images.
